## Get Disciplined ##
_Summary done by some_ [redditor](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/852fym/method_pdf_i_was_disappointed_with_my_life_so_i/)  
_Some emphasis added by me_  

+ No more Zero work days
    - If you didn't do anything till 11:58 PM, Do something, Do one pushup, Do write one sentence, read something, but **NO ZERO WORK DAYS**
    - It will result in massive string of CONSISTENT NON ZEROS (small ONE in NON ZERO)

+ Gratitude & the 3 You's
    - Past You, Present You, Future You
    - Be grateful to the past you for the positive thing you've done
    - Salad & veggies instead of Big Mac? THANK PAST YOU
    - Make sure that future self is grateful to present self
    - The cycle of doing something for someone else (future you) & thanking someone for the good in your life(past you) is key to building gratitude & productivity
+ Forgiveness & You
    - Forgive yourself for the bad decisions you have taken
    - Being disappointed in yourself causes you to be less productive
+ Exercise, Meditate, Talk, Hug & Read Books
    - Endorphins, Oxytocin & Mental high
    - > You are not the first person to face life issues. Humans have known writing for 5000 years, the knowledge of the whole species is with you in the form of books
+ **Implement**: Thought without Actions are nothing
+ Create a system, Not a Goal
    - Goals reduce your current happiness
    - Your goal will not keep you motivated for long term, But the system will
    - Release the need for immediate results. Screw Instant gratification
    - Create a feedback loop in system. System must perfect itself over time
    - System is discipline
+ Motivation is Temporary, Discipline is _Forever_
    - Motivation operates on the erroneous assumption that a particular mental or emotional state is necessary to complete a task
    - Discipline, by contrast, separates outwards functioning from moods & feeling & thereby ironically circumvents the problem by consistently improving them
    - > If you wait until you feel like doing stuff, you're never going to do it

+ S.M.A.R.T goals
    - Specific: ask yourself- Who, What, Where, When, Which & most importantly **Why**
    - Measurable: concrete criteria for measuring progress(~~almost done~~[60% done])
    - Attainable: develop the attitudes, abilities, skills & financial capacity to reach goals. _attainable means goals that can be fulfilled. I want to memorize every points on this technical documentation_
    - Realistic: One realistic Mega-goal & many achievable real mini-goals _realistic on how many things you can do in a day_
    - Timely: Make a System, Test the System, Follow the System, Be the System
+ Divide tasks into ABCDE & 1-X. Execute tasks in order A1, A2..A[X], B, C , D, E[X]
    - A: **A**bsolutely Must Do
    - B: It would be **B**est if you could do it.
    - C: I don't **C**are if this doesn't get done today.
    - D: **D**elegate this task to someone else[Do not spend much Time in Delegating]
    - E: **E**liminate from day - Cross it off the list[D & E both can be crossed off]

+ > Be Proactive  
    Begin with end in mind  
    Put first thing first  
    Think win-win  
    Empathize  
    Synergize : _the habit of creative cooperation. It is teamwork, open-mindedness, and the adventure of finding new solutions to old problems. But it doesn't just happen on its own. It's a process, and through that process, people bring all their personal experience and expertise to the table._
