### How to win friends and Influence people ###

This book is called most influential book of the centuries and must read on most of list. However, people are also not comfortable of the idea of hacking social interaction. They argue that it is cheating to learn how to interact. I have had my reservation. But just wanted to see what the deal was about, I picked up this book.  

I have to tell you that author does acknowledge that  
+ one must sincerely apply the methods and must be genuine
    - if appreciation or smile is genuine, people have uncanny way of knowing it.
+ it yields better result than having nothing and going with the instinct of (animal).  

Initial reactions:  
+ he understand the psychology of pride. how pride can have impact on people life, how it makes us to something unhelpful for the situation. Understand and acknowledge this human nature.  
+ Default reaction like being angry, applying force in the situation is counter productive. This can be seen on how parents punish their child, or while fear is used to incentivize which backfires.
+ **stories are cheesy** Way to cheesy to my liking. I felt stories were contrived to make a certain point. I was like how can people behave all the time. I mean it makes sense but it only works if other people is rational. 
    - I thought how it would work with people who refuse to stand in other person shoe or is arrogant or with little education.
+ Gist of it is to :
    - try to understand other person point of view,
    - be empathic to fellow person,
    - conventional way might be counter-productive or in a long term do more harm,
    - don't criticize person or act, when you have to - apply tact.

### Points from the books ###
Reading chapter introduction is fare better than the point. I found the principles, summary of the chapter , less useful. It often lack explanation. Anyway, here is his main points from the book: 

**Fundamental Techniques in Handling People**  
1. > Don't criticize, condemn or complain.  
1. > Give honest and sincere appreciation.  
1. > Arouse in the other person an eager want.  

**Six ways to make people like you**
1. > Become genuinely interested in other people.  
1. > Smile  
1. > Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.  
1. > Be a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.  
1. > Talk in terms of the other person's interests.  
1. > Make the other person feel important-and do it sincerely.

1. > The only way to get the best of an argument is to avoid it.

    + this was the most interesting one, mentions Socratic method.

1. > Begin with praise and honest appreciation.
1. > Call attention to people's mistake indirectly.
1. > Talk about your own mistakes before criticizing the other person.
1. > Ask questions instead of giving direct others.
    + thought this was interesting, way of suggestion, as it becomes like order when you have authority or seniority
1. > Let the other person save face.
    + in other words, don't criticize, let them save their pride.
1. > Praise the slightest improvement and praise every improvement. Be "hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise."
1. > Give the other person a fine reputation to live up to.
1. > Use encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.
1. > Make the other person happy about doing the thing you suggest.  

I think, just reading principle does not give you full appreciation or full picture. I would suggest you to give it a read once. It is not all applicable to daily life. However, it does have some of the powerful points.
