## TIL/rpun101

_**1** TIL and counting..._

_A collection of concise write-ups on small things we learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post._

My attempt to 'Today I Learnt(TIL)' following [jbranchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) example which was featured in [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11068902)  

Some thoughts:  
+ Will append article, so it would be easy to see related information in one file
+ Will add **RECALL** section, I plan to recall topics at the end of week, 1 week => 1 month => 3 month

### Tasks ###
