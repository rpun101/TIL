+ Generally, Asking **WHY** leads us to fixate on the problems.

+ > if you ask why, [I think] you're putting yourself into a victim mentality ...
+ Instead lead introspecting with **WHAT**  
    _What kind of person they were?, What did you do to feel this way?_  
+ > "Why" questions traps us in our pas: "what** questions help us create a better future.  
+ Asking **what** force us to name our emotions.  
+ **Exception:** Why Q is effective while navigating business challenges or solving problems in your team or organization.

> A good rule of thumb, then, is that _why_ questions are generally better to help us understand events in our environment and _what_ questions are generally better to help us understand ourselves.
